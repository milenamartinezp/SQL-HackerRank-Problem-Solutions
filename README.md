# SQL-HackerRank-Problem-Solutions 👩🏻‍💻📚📝
This repository contains my solutions to various SQL challenges and problems from HackerRank. It serves as a personal archive for my SQL coding exercises and solutions, making it easier to organize, share, and collaborate on SQL-related tasks. Feel free to explore the solutions and use them for your reference or learning purposes.

## Getting Started
To access the solutions, simply browse the repository's file structure. Problem descriptions are provided in markdown files, and SQL code solutions are stored in separate SQL files. Each problem is well-documented with a description in the "Problem.md" file and the SQL solution in a corresponding "Solution.sql" file.

## File Structure
- `Problem.md`: Description of the problem and link to HackerRank.
- `Solution.sql`: SQL code solution for Problem 1.
